To build this document, if you have 'make' and 'awk', simply give the command:

  % make VOUnits.pdf

This generates the file `known-units.tex` (derived from
`unity-grammars/known-units.csv`) and runs LaTeX on the document source.

The contents of the directory `unity-grammars`, containing the
machine-readable version of the list of known units, and the
yacc-style grammars, is derived from the Unity project; see
<https://purl.org/nxg/dist/unity>, and the repository at
<https://hg.sr.ht/~nxg/unity>.  You can obtain an updated copy of the
grammars from the Unity distribution, or by checking out the
repository, and building `src/grammar/unity-grammars.zip`.  In either
case, unzip the contents here and commit the update.
